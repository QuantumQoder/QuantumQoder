- 👋 Hi, I’m @QuantumQoder (Pratik Das)
- 👀 I’m interested in the advancements of quantum technologies, including computing, networking, machine learning, sensing and developing quantum algorithms, with their implementations in real-world scenarios.
- 🌱 My technical skillset encompasses programming languages like [Python](https://www.python.org), [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) and [C++](https://isocpp.org), including quantum SDKs like [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org), [QuTIP](https://qutip.org), [StrawberryFields](https://strawberryfields.ai), [Pennylane](https://pennylane.ai) and [Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq). I'm also proficient in quantum programming languages like [Silq](https://silq.ethz.ch/#) with some level of expertise in [Q#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/). I also possess a basic understanding of machine learning modules, such as [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of the topics related to quantum information and computation.
