- 👋 Hi, I’m [@quantumqoder (Pratik Das)](https://github.com/quantumqoder).
- 👀 I’m interested in the advancements of machine learning and quantum technologies with their performance in real-world scenarios.
- 🌱 My technical skillset encompasses programming languages like [C++](https://isocpp.org), [Python](https://www.python.org) and [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) among many others, and quantum SDKs such as [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org), [QuTIP](https://qutip.org), [Mitiq](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [Pennylane](https://pennylane.ai) and [Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq). With a solid understanding of machine learning frameworks, I'm proficient in related modules like [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to machine learning & generative a.i., as well as in quantum computations & simulations. I also want to reinforce my C++-OOP skills, so a collaboration in embedded systems and C++ software development would be be instrumental.
