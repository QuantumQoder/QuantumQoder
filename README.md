- 👋 Hi, I’m @QuantumQoder (Pratik Das)
- 👀 I’m interested in the advancements of quantum technologies, including computing, networking, machine learning, sensing and developing quantum algorithms, with their implementations in real-world scenarios.
- 🌱 My technical skillset encompasses programming languages like [Python][https://www.python.org], [Java][https://www.java.com/en/] and [C++][https://isocpp.org], including quantum SDKs like [Qiskit][https://qiskit.org], [QuTIP][https://qutip.org], [StrawberryFields][https://strawberryfields.ai], [Pennylane][https://pennylane.ai] and [Cirq][https://quantumai.google/cirq]. I'm also proficient in quantum programming languages like [Silq][https://silq.ethz.ch/#] with some level of expertise in [Q#][https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/]. I also possess a basic understanding of machine learning modules, such as [PyTorch][https://pytorch.org] and [TensorFlow][https://www.tensorflow.org].
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of the topics related to quantum information and computation.
